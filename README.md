# LeahCogs

Various cogs made for my [Discord-RedBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) instance, LeahBot.

## Installation

I need to figure this out myself lol

## Cogs

### AskLeah

Built upon the 8Ball command in the General Cog, just gives us the ability to have custom responses from Leah.

### GoodBoyPoints

Requested by a friend, allows users of a server to give `GoodBoyPoints` to other members for being good noodles

### StreamBingo

Was an addition to my [Viewer Bingo](https://github.com/mFireworks/Viewer-Bingo) project, moved the bingo card generation from being done by hand to a bot that viewers can request from.
